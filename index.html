                                        Mortgage protection is a simplified, quick issue insurance that is used to protect our client’s greatest asset. Mortgage protection plans are designed to provide a death benefit to pay off all, or a portion of, a client’s mortgage. Optional riders are available in most states, such as disability income and return of premium, which refunds all, or part of, the premium paid if the policy is unused. This product, offered by many of our carriers, can be customized to fit each client’s needs and budget.

                                       Disability insurance can help you replace a portion of your income when you are sick or injured and unable to work.  Many people use disability coverage to provide payments for their mortgage,  vehicles, or other household expenses during that difficult time.  Having this kind of coverage helps our clients to have peace of mind, knowing that in the event of a disability they will still have a monthly income.  Individuals must qualify for disability coverage, which is dependent on a number of factors including current health and medical history, age, and occupation.

                                        Critical illness insurance is medical insurance that provides a lump-sum benefit upon diagnosis of a covered critical illness or condition.  This payout helps our clients avoid the financial burden that can be created by those illnesses.  Our clients have found this benefit payout useful for getting the treatment they want, spending time with their family and friends, keeping their home, and filling in the financial gaps left by most medical insurances.  Individuals must qualify for critical illness coverage which is dependent on a number of factors including, current health and medical history, age, and occupation.

Indexed Universal Life insurance (“IUL”) is the fastest growing type of life insurance in the industry today. IUL is a form of permanent life insurance that provides a death benefit – a valuable resource for family members, business associates or other beneficiaries if a policy holder should die prematurely. The death benefit is generally paid income tax free to beneficiaries — a benefit only available on life insurance. This flexible form of life insurance allows our clients to choose the coverage amount based on the premium they prefer to pay and it also allows them to make changes to it as their needs change. IUL policies can build cash value over time to help provide funds for emergencies, education expenses, supplement retirement income or just to grow assets on a tax-deferred basis. The interest credits to the cash value are linked to the performance of stock market indexes, but are not a direct investment in equities, so the cash value is protected from market loss, providing more protection for the insured. Properly structured policies can provide tax-free retirement income …. and we can show you how!

                                        An annuity can be used to save for retirement, preserve funds already saved for retirement and to provide a steady stream of income during retirement. They have become a very popular choice for retirement planning, especially with the stock market volatility over the last decade.   Annuities are financial contracts between an insurance company and contract owners.  Payments into an annuity can be made via a lump sum, or a series of monthly payments to the insurance company.  These funds will accumulate on a tax-deferred basis, which can be a tremendous advantage over time. Fixed Index Annuities provide an opportunity for growth without the risk involved with most investments.  This is especially attractive to pre-retirees and retirees looking to preserve assets they have built over several decades.  Many annuities offer the ability to add optional benefits such as a life-time income rider, which gives clients a guaranteed income no matter how long they live.  Our dedicated annuity advisory team is always available to assist our agents in finding the best and most suitable annuity product to fit each client’s needs.

                                service possible. Our fully qualified staff can assist agents

                                By utilizing our Agent Concierge Hotline, our agents can call and speak to an experienced field agent at any time of day, whether they are preparing for an appointment or sitting in front of a client.

                                At Equis we provide the most aggressive compensation plan for our agents. Our agents start on high commission
                                schedules with clear promotion standards. Motivated agents quickly earn higher and higher contract levels.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With guaranteed vesting, agents can build a book of business to generate passive income through renewals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Agency builders can use the Equis turn-key system to build
                                successful, profitable agencies.
                            </p>

                                The Equis Bonus Program further rewards hardworking agents and agency managers for their efforts.

                                Equis Financial takes a lot of pride in being one of the few companies that does not nickel and dime their agents with membership fees, club fees, contract promotion fees, or
                                training fees. So that means  our agents keep the money they earn. That’s what you get from a company founded by agents for agents!
